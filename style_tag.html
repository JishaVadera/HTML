        <p>Polistes gallicus is a species of paper wasp found in a region from the Alps south into 
            northwest Africa and east to Croatia and Corfu.
             It can live in a range of temperatures including warmer climates and cooler regions north of the Alps, 
             with nests created in these various conditions.
              A social insect, the species uses an oral secretion to construct its nests, 
              which consist of a combination of saliva and chewed plant fibers.</p>
